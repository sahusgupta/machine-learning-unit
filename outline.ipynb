    "Think of a real world problem that can be solved or addressed using machine learning. Then, use Kaggle to find a dataset that matches the problem or issue you have identified. Create a short, 200-300 word paper that describes the problem you have identified, and explains the machine learning algorithm that you think is most appropriate, or briefly describe the deep learning tools you will use to create a program that addresses the issue. You will be scored on your paper, the implementation of the machine learning algorithms, and the creativity you use for the project. Bonus points will be awarded to students that create some sort of visual interface for their algorithm to interact with, but is not required."
